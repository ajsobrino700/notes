# Pass

Pass is a very interesting tool of cli to manage password, It is a password storage encrypt with **gpg**.

We need to install [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), but this tool has several extensions, in my case I am going to use [pass tail](https://github.com/palortoff/pass-extension-tail#readme) and for the correct work of the tool is mandatory to install [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions?tab=readme-ov-file)
